Advanced shortcuts
[*type][*levels]ib	do something inside inner block
[*type][*levels]iB	do something inside curly brackets
[*type][*levels]ab	do something inside inner block with brackets
[*type][*levels]aB	do something inside inner block with brackets
*type - i.e. 'v', 'c', 'y'

to make selection inclusive use can use 'a' instead of 'i'
replace 'B' and 'b' with something like '{' or '}', '(' or ')' to perform action inside them
*levels - levels of parens up
